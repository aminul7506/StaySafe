This is an androoid application. This is one of my dream project in my life.
I have used google api and firebase cloud server for storing users' data.
There are two parts.
(i) User Side.
(ii) Police Side.
User Side fuctionalities:
1. User will create account and then log in.
2. User can report a crime report and the report will store in corresponding thana database.
3. User can see the verified crimes in an area.
4. User can see the nearby police station based on his current location and can call to thana in case of an emergency
5. User can see nearby hospitals.
6. If user now in a crime area , then he will get a notifications from server
7. User can see crime statistics in his/her area.
8. User can call his nearby friends in an area.
9. User can see nearby friends location in google map.
10. User can see all the cimes happened in his area.
11. user can message to nearby thana if he/she is in danger now.

Police Side Functionalities:
1. Police can log into his thana
2. Police can see the reported crime in his area and can veirfy it.
3. Police can track a thief
4. Polce can send message to a user or can contact with him/her.
5. Police can see crimes statistics in his/her area.
